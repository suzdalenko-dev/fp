To start the Laravel development server, you need to run the `php artisan serve` command in your terminal. Here is how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your Laravel project directory. For example:
    ```sh
    cd /e:/fp/
    ```
3. Run the following command to start the Laravel development server:
    ```sh
    php artisan serve
    ```

This will start the server and you can access your Laravel application at `http://localhost:8000`.

Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed on your system before running the command.
To create a new model in Laravel, you can use the `php artisan make:model` command. Here is how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your Laravel project directory. For example:
    ```sh
    cd /e:/fp/
    ```
3. Run the following command to create a new model:
    ```sh
    php artisan make:model ModelName
    ```

Replace `ModelName` with the name of the model you want to create. This will generate a new model file in the `app/Models` directory.
